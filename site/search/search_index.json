Before embedding the livechat, make sure that you receive your livechat-id and tenant-id from our support. We provide two ways to embed a livechat. Both accept configuration options, language configuration and preconditions. Options A livechat instance has various options to control its behavior: captureLinks: boolean - a click on any link in the chat history will prevent transition and emit a CapturedLink event Programmatic livechat creation The livechat can be initialized via JavaScript. This is the preferred way if you're planning to use smoope as a support chat on your website. To add a livechat to a regular HTML page, you have to first load the embeddable JavaScript file. <script async defer src=\"https://<tenantId>-chat.smoope.net/embed.js\"></script> As the snippet uses async defer to prevent blocking your own JavaScript, you have to wait for the window to be loaded before initializing the livechat. <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.addEventListener('load', function () { // Initialize a livechat instance (Note: this doesn't start/insert it into DOM). var chat = new smoopeChat.default(document.querySelector('#chat'), { livechat: '<livechat-id>', language: 'fr', preconditions: { language: 'fr', zip: '1845' }, }); // Insert livechat instance into DOM. chat.insert(); }); </script> Once the chat is inserted, smoope will automatically show a button to let the user request support if possible. The returned chat instance acts as an event emitter. Exposed events: captureLinks , if the captureLinks option is enabled with {url: string} as event payload Example on how to capture link clicks var chat = new smoopeChat.default(document.querySelector('#chat'), { // ... other options captureLinks: true }); chat.on(\"capturedLink\", function(data) { alert(`user clicked a link: ${data.url}`); }); Automatic livechat creation via URL If you can't execute JavaScript in your App, you can easily embed the livechat by using a Webview. `http://${tenantId}-chat.smoope.net/${livechatId}` To configure the instance, you can provide preconditions, language and other options as query parameters. The complex values have to be stringified and url encoded. For example to pass the preconditions {\"foo\": \"bar\"} , append a query parameter preconditions=%7B%22foo%22%3A%22bar%22%7D . The supported query parameters are preconditions , language and options Example code to build a embeddable chat url in JavaScript const language = 'fr'; const preconditions = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({ language, zip: '1845' })); const options = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({ captureLinks: true })); const url = `http://${tenantId}-chat.smoope.net/${livechatId}` + `?language=${language}` + `&preconditions=${preconditions}` + `&options=${options}`; If the livechat is embedded via url, we emit the following events using the postMessage API. Messages are serialized as JSON objects. Due to missing bridge between JavaScript and Android/iOS, we have to write some custom code to listen for emitted events. (See \"Handling events in Android\" and \"Handling events in iOS\") MessageEvent data type type MessageEventData = { type: string, data: Object, _by: 'smoope', }; // Example MessageEvent // {\"type\":\"ReadyToSupport\",\"data\":{\"room\":\"01CXWBKT6Q6YCV1X12FNSJ0QDR\"},\"_by\":\"smoope\"} We emit the following types via postMessage . CapturedLink , if the captureLinks option is enabled with {url: string} as event payload ReadyToSupport , if the chat is initialized far enough to accept support input from the user RoomClosed , if the current support room is closed SupportRequestRejected , if the current support request got rejected Listening for events in Android In Android, you have to define a JavaScript interface to inject into the WebView . Using the addJavascriptInterface , register your Interface as SMOOPE_IPC . This allows us to call your Interface, if defined. Custom JavaScript interface to add to the webview class dummy.app.snippets.support.integration.SmoopeIpc { @JavascriptInterface public void postMessage(String data, String origin) { // handle livechat event System.out.println(\"Smoope chat emitted data: \" + data + \" \" + origin); } } Enable JavaScript and register your interface as SMOOPE_IPC webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true); webView.addJavascriptInterface(new dummy.app.snippets.support.integration.SmoopeIpc(), \"SMOOPE_IPC\"); webView.loadUrl(\"<webchat-url>\"); Listening for events in iOS Similar to Android, in iOS, you have to register a listener for a custom messageHandler method on a WKWebView . Use the SMOOPE_IPC name to add to the WKUserContentController . Setup the WKWebView to receive livechat events let config = WKWebViewConfiguration() config.preferences.javaScriptEnabled = true let userContentController = WKUserContentController() userContentController.add(self, name: \"SMOOPE_IPC\") config.userContentController = userContentController webView.load(URLRequest(url: URL(string: \"<webchat-url>\")!))

First [set](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#setWebChromeClient(android.webkit.WebChromeClient)) a [`WebChromeClient`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebChromeClient) on the `WebView` instance. Next you can implement the [`onShowFileChooser`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebChromeClient#onShowFileChooser(android.webkit.WebView,%2520android.webkit.ValueCallback%3Candroid.net.Uri%5B%5D%3E,%2520android.webkit.WebChromeClient.FileChooserParams)) to fit your use-case. iOS Setup Similar to Android, in iOS, you have to register a listener for a custom messageHandler method on a WKWebView . Use the SMOOPE_IPC name to add to the WKUserContentController . Setup the WKWebView to receive livechat events: {{#docs-demo as |demo|}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/webview-setup-ios.swift' language='swift' label=\"Swift\"}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/webview-setup-ios.m' language='obj-c' label=\"Objective-C\"}} {{/docs-demo}} Listen for messages with the SMOOPE_IPC name: {{#docs-demo as |demo|}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/ipc-ios.swift' language='swift' label=\"Swift\"}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/ipc-ios.m' language='obj-c' label=\"Objective-C\"}} {{/docs-demo}} Opening external links If you want to allow the livechat to open external links, you have to make additional adjustments. The following snippets allows the webview to open external links by intercepting navigation actions. {{#docs-demo as |demo|}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/external-links-ios.swift' language='swift' label=\"Swift\"}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/external-links-ios.m' language='obj-c' label=\"Objective-C\"}} {{/docs-demo}} Authenticating a user In cases where you have an authenticated user and want to pass its identity to our system, you can do that by configuring the token query parameter. Simply append the parameter to your existing WebView url and load the chat. The livechat will use that token to create request against our api. If the provided token expires, the chat emits a RequestToken event which allows you to refresh the token. To do that, post a web message, using the RequestTokenResponse event data: {{#docs-demo as |demo|}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/token-response.kt' language='kotlin' label=\"Kotlin\"}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/token-response.java' language='java' label=\"Java\"}} {{demo.snippet name='support/integration/RequestTokenResponseData.ts' language='ts' label=\"RequestTokenResponse type\"}} {{/docs-demo}} Posting a message from iOS Because iOS exposes no way to communicate from iOS context to the WKWebview context, you have to make additional adjustments. If the app is launched inside a WKWebview, we register a global wkSmoopePostMessage method. This allows you to use the evaluateJavaScript method, to emit data to the chat. The method accepts a JSON-Object which contains the message information. {{docs-snippet name='support/integration/token-response.swift' title='Responding to a token request with a new token' language='swift'}}","title":"Support livechat in a webview"},{"location":"Messaging/integration/support/webview/#support-livechat-in-a-webview","text":"The support integration in a webview happens by opening the WebView with a preconfigured url.

What to expect This manual explains how to install a helpLine system including the necessary preparation and configuration tasks. * In Preparing the installation (on page 7), you will find the hardware and software requirements as well as instructions on how to prepare your environment and the destination system. Furthermore, if you plan to use AD FS with helpLine, you will find detailed information here. * Section Installing helpLine (on page 39) explains the installation of helpLine including the setup of the SQL database server. * A helpLine system configuration very much depends on the individual customer requirements. In Configuring helpLine (on page 53) you learn how to choose and configure the different system components after the installation has been completed successfully. Note: For information on additional components, such as start configurations or Add-ons, please refer to the corresponding installation manuals. Who should read this manual? Note: Since helpLine is typically customized according to your individual requirements, the installation should always be done in close contact with your helpLine Customer Project Manager. This manual provides information for: * IT or helpLine administrators, who install and set up helpLine systems. * You should participate in the helpLine Administrator Training before installing and configuring a helpLine system. Please contact your Customer Project Manager for details. Typical installation scenarios A typical helpLine system requires at least: * a helpLine application server, * an SQL database server, * a web server for running the helpLine web modules (Portal, WebDesk, MobileDesk). These servers do not have to run on dedicated machines. Depending on your individual performance requirements, the following basic installation scenarios are possible: One machine running all servers In this scenario, the helpLine application server, the database server, and the web server are installed on the same machine. Dedicated machine for the database server In this scenario, the helpLine application server and the web server run on the same machine, while the database server runs on a dedicated machine. Dedicated machines for helpLine application server, database server, and web server In this scenario, a dedicated machine is provided for each server.
