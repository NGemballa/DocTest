The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, datas structures, \u2026) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, \u2026) This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation. In analogy to a house this is the floor plan . Motivation. Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through abstraction. This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details. Form. The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes (see figure below) and their descriptions. Level 1 is the white box description of the overall system together with black box descriptions of all contained building blocks. Level 2 zooms into some building blocks of level 1. Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks. Level 3 zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on. Whitebox Overall System Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains an overview diagram a motivation for the decomposition black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives: use one table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).

(optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box. Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.

Include the package \ud83d\udce6 To include the Notification Module execute the following command in your project directory: yarn add @sw/notificationmodule@^1 Make sure to load the mandatory file e.g. for angular in the angular.json: \"scripts\": [ \"node_modules/@sw/notificationmodule/dist/elements/notification-module.js\" ], \"styles\": [ \"node_modules/@sw/notificationmodule/dist/elements/notification-module.css\" ] If your application is not using the SW control library you also must include the mandatory style file e.g. for angular in the angular.json: \"styles\": [ \"node_modules/@sw/notificationmodule/dist/elements/sw-angular-controls.css\" ] Add this polyfill to your polyfill.ts // Used for browsers with partially native support of Custom Elements import '@webcomponents/custom-elements/src/native-shim'; 3. Use it \ud83c\udf89 When using it inside an Angular application you can use it in HTML file like this: <sw-notification-module [attr.service-url]=\"'THE_URL_TO_THE_NOTIFICATION_MODULE_SERVER'\" [attr.lang]=\"'THE_LANGUAGE_OF_THE_USER'\" [attr.id-token]=\"'THE_OPENIDCONNECT_ID_TOKEN'\" [attr.user-id]=\"'THE_USER_IDENTIFIER'\"></sw-notification-module> When using it in e.g. a plain web application you can also use it like this: <sw-notification-module></sw-notification-module> const element = document.querySelector('sw-notification-module'); element.setAttribute('service-url', 'THE_URL_TO_THE_NOTIFICATION_MODULE_SERVER'); element.setAttribute('lang', 'THE_LANGUAGE_OF_THE_USER'); element.setAttribute('id-token', 'THE_OPENIDCONNECT_ID_TOKEN'); element.setAttribute('user-id', 'THE_USER_IDENTIFIER'); Microsoft Internet Explorer Support If you need to support Microsoft Internet Explorer, make sure to install these dependencies: \"dependencies\": { ... \"core-js\": \"3.3.3\", \"custom-event-polyfill\": \"1.0.7\", \"ie11-custom-properties\": \"3.0.6\", ... } and import them in your polyfill.ts // Used for browsers without a native support of Custom Elements import '@webcomponents/custom-elements/custom-elements.min'; // IE 11 Support import 'core-js'; import 'custom-event-polyfill'; import 'ie11-custom-properties'; In case you encounter a zone.js SecurityError in the console of Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps to solve it: https://github.com/angular/zone.js/issues/1001 Features for the Notification Module that are not supported in Microsoft Internet Explorer: - Desktop Notifications Server \ud83d\udce1 1. Get the binaries \ud83e\uddfe You can get the latest binaries by executing the following command in the directory you want to copy them: \\\\lab-build01\\ArtifactRepository\\.cli\\buildcli.cmd get -p NotificationModule.Deployment -n -s \"https://tfs.pmcs-helpline.com/tfs/Helpline/Common/_git/NotificationModule\" Optionally you can also specify to just get the binaries for a specific runtime by appending -f Deployment/<RuntimeIdentifier> to the command. Available runtimes are: | Identifier | Description | | ---------- | ------------------ | | win-arm | Windows on ARM | | win-x64 | Windows x86 64-Bit | | linux-arm | Linux ARM | | linux-x64 | Linux x64 64-Bit | 2. Setup the server \ud83d\udcbb After getting the binaries you can find the setup script to install the Notification Module in the folder Deployment/<RuntimeIdentifier>. For Windows Deployments you can find a \"setup.cmd\" and for Linux a \"setup .sh\" script. You can pass in the following arguments for both install and uninstall commands: | Argument | Description | | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | -s | --silent | Runs the setup without any user interaction. | | -f | --force | Ignores checks for the Installation location.

You can also specify all the information, if you want to run the setup automatically using the --silent switch, with the following arguments: | Argument | Description | | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | -p | --path | The path to which the Notification Module should be installed to. This path should be a non-existant or empty directory. | | -T | --db-type | The database engine to use.

Only valid for MSSql and provided service user. | | -t | --install-type | The type of installation. Can be one of the following values: Service, IISApplication, IISWebSite. | | -S | --certificate-store | The store of the certificate to use for the IIS Website or Windows Service. | | --cert-allow-invalid | Allow invalid certificates. | | -c | --certificate-thumbprint | The thumbprint of the certificate to use for the IIS Website or Windows Service. | | --set-cert-permission | Set read permissions for the specified certificate from the store for service-user. | There is also a \"setup-silent\" script in which you can type in all the information for faster reinstallation at a later point. Important: Adjust the appsettings.json file in the chosen installation path after installation finished so it fits your requirements. Uninstall If you want to uninstall a Notification Module Installation, just call the setup script with the \"uninstall\" parameter.
